description: "Learn how to create or update contacts in bulk using the Notocat API. This guide covers the POST /contacts endpoint, allowing you to manage your subscriber data efficiently."
---

The endpoint can be used to create a full list of contacts with Notocat. If a contact already exists, the data will be merged. The contacts can be updated in bulk when provided with IDs or emails that already exist in the database. If the contact does not exist, it will be created with the email provided.

**The endpoint accepts a minimum of 1 contact and a maximum of 1000 contacts.**
