# Custom CSS for your issues

Notocat allows you to modify the visuals of your issues on top of Notion's built-in customization options. One of the options is to add custom CSS to your issues. Read more to learn what are the available classes you can use in the CSS.

<Warning>
Please note that the CSS needs to be valid and supported by all the email clients. We recommend using [Can I Email](https://www.caniemail.com/) to check the compatibility of your CSS. A small issue in the CSS can invalidate the entire styling of your issue in some email clients.
